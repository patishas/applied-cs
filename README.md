### Gradient Domain Copy-Paste

Code that seamlessly blends a source image into a target image using Poisson blending, works similarly to the blending tools in Adobe Photoshop

The significance of this is that it blends in all 2 dimensions, creating a gradual transition from the source image to the target image in all directions.
If we had blended in 1D, there would've been 2 visible borders of the source image, and if we hadn't blended at all (think a simple copy-paste), all 4 borders of the source
image would've been visible. The beauty of this code is that it can be applied to any 2 images whose backgrounds are relatively similar and uniform.

A sample image generated by this code (titled "Resulting Image from Gradient Descent Copy Paste") is viewable in this repository.
It blends an image of an airplane and the Burj Khalifa.
